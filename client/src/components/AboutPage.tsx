                        <Content>
                          Ryan grew up in San Jose, California, and later moved
                          to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he graduated from
                          the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill with a
                          B.S. in Biology, and minors in Chemistry and Spanish.
                          His interest gradually turned from medicine to a more
                          specific scope - oral surgery - after shadowing
                          numerous different surgical specialists.

                          Inspired by the challenge and exposure the city would
                          offer, he chose to attend dental school at Columbia
                          University's College of Dental Medicine - the premier
                          Ivy-League institution in New York City. As fortune
                          would have it, he met his wife on his first day on
                          campus. While at Columbia, he and the Class of 2015
                          enacted several changes in student body legislation
                          and local community healthcare initiatives that would
                          impact the institution for years to come. As Dr. Patel
                          honed his surgical skills through additional rotations
                          in the oral & maxillofacial surgery department at
                          Columbia, he realized he truly wanted to impact the
                          field.

                          Dr. Patel was selected to one of the most rigorous and
                          prestigious oral maxillofacial surgery residency in
                          the country - Washington Hospital Center. In addition
                          to operating at Washington Hospital Center (DC's
                          largest hospital and level-1 trauma center), he also
                          saw patients at the National Institutes of Health
                          (NIH), Children’s National Medical Center, Washington
                          DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Greater Baltimore
                          Medical Center, and the world-famous Johns Hopkins
                          Hospital. He served as Chief Resident during his last
                          year of residency.

                          innovation, as well as operational excellence in
                          surgical practice. He has lectured on the national
